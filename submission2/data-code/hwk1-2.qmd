My answers to the homework questions are described below. Note that I do the analysis for these answers in a separate `R` script. You can read in the full data as part of your markdown file, but that takes some time to compile to pdf. So I run the analysis separately, save the workspace with only the summary stats, figures, and tables that I need, and then load the workspace in the final qmd. My analysis file is available in the analysis folder. The GitHub repository for this work is available [here](https://github.com/genevievedebell/hwk1). Enjoy!

# Building the Data
Answer the following based on our initial, simplified dataset of enrollments, plan types, and service areas:

\noindent 1. Provide a table of the count of plans under each plan type in each year.<br>

See @tbl-plans.

```{r} 
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-plans
#| tbl-cap: All plan types in 2015

options(knitr.kable.NA = 0)
knitr::kable(plan.type.year1, 
             col.names=c("Plan Type","Count"),
             format.args=list(big.mark=","), booktabs = TRUE)
```




\newpage
\noindent 2. Remove all special needs plans (SNP), employer group plans (eghp), and all "800-series" plans. Provide an updated table after making these exclusions.


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-plans2
#| tbl-cap: Revised plan types in 2015

options(knitr.kable.NA = 0)
knitr::kable(plan.type.year2, 
             col.names=c("Plan Type","Count"),
             format.args=list(big.mark=","), booktabs = TRUE)
``` 




\newpage
\noindent 3. Provide a table of the average enrollments for each plan type in 2015.


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-enroll
#| tbl-cap: Enrollments by plan type in 2015

options(knitr.kable.NA = 0)
knitr::kable(plan.type.enroll, digits=0,
             col.names=c("Plan Type","Count","Avg Enrollments"),
             format.args=list(big.mark=","), booktabs = TRUE)
```
